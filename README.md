Status: when someone messages me on my aztechmart page, i recieve that message on the deployed chatbot server. on vercel.com click on the chatbot, go to logs and you will see the recieved message.

goal: i want to prompt the user with a set of responses in order to fill out a form of information that will be sent to me so that i can respond with a qoute and arrange a meetup.
